# Task Management App

This repository contains a console-based Task Management Application implemented in Kotlin. The application provides a simple yet effective way to manage tasks, allowing users to perform various actions such as adding tasks, displaying them, completing tasks, modifying task details, searching for tasks, and exiting the program.

## Features

1. **Add Task:** Users can add tasks with details such as name, due date, and priority.

2. **Display Tasks:** View the list of tasks, sorted by either due date or priority.

3. **Complete Task:** Mark tasks as completed.

4. **Modify Task:** Modify task details, including name, due date, priority, and estimated time for timed tasks.

5. **Search Task:** Search for tasks based on name, due date, or priority.

6. **Exit:** Safely exit the Task Management Application.

## Project Structure

- **manager:** Contains classes for managing tasks and users.
- **model:** Defines task models, including the base `Task` class and a specialized `TimedTask` class.
